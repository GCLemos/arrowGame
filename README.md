# arrowGame
A game made with processing that uses analog input from a potenciometer to adjust the bow inclination in real time, based on the potenciometer value.

## ATENTION
In order to use this processing code, first you need to configure your arduino.
You can find the code that I used in the main branch.
It uses the .ino extension.

### The USB port may vary, mine was the second port, so the 1 index, and has the following name: /dev/ttyUSB0.
